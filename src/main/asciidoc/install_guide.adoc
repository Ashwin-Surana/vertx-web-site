= Vert.x install guide

You can use Vert.x in your Maven or Gradle projects by simply adding dependencies to the Vert.x artifacts, but if
you want to use Vert.x at the command line you will need to install it first.

== Download Vert.x

The Vert.x distribution can be downloaded from https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/view[Bintray].

A good place to unzip the distribution is into your home directory:

----
cd
tar -zxf ../Downloads/vertx-3.0.0-dist.tar.gz
----

Now add the Vert.x install `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

Now check it's installed:

----
> vertx version
3.0.0
----

You should see output similar to the above.
